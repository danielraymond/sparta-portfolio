# Sparta Portfolio

### Brief:

I have completed 8 of the deliverables for this assignment.

The deliverables that I have failed to complete are:
1. A well styled layout that is responsive - I tried to make the website responsive however after a number of difficulties getting the elements to display properly I decided to focus on other tasks.

2. A contact section with your details - I made a contact section however I did not have time to style it properly or add links.

3. All up to date information about yourself - I added some content to the about me section but I didn't know what to add to the experience section.



### The most difficult thing to implement:

I found getting elements to sit in the correct place the most difficult thing to implement. I am fairly happy with the position of everything on a full screen. On a smaller screen I struggled to get things to adjust properly. I believe this is because of height, margin and padding settings I implemented. I think that with more time I could produce a responsive page.

### The thing I am most proud of:

I am proud of the initial screen that is visible when the page is loaded. I think that it looks fairly professional and I am happy that the page mostly functions.
